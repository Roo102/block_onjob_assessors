Etco On-Job Assessors Block
===========================

The Etco On-Job Assessors Block is designed to work with the Moodle Assign Module, it dynamically retrieves a list of Assignment submissions which are awaiting grading and have had an Assessor (Marker) allocated to complete this grading.

The block will show a list of Assignment submissions allocated to the logged in user in order of assignment number and then submission date.

Each list item is a dynamic link to the Assignment submission grading page and is coloured according to the number of days since submission as follows.
* These are default values which can be adjusted in the settings page
    * Links in red have been submitted more than 30 days ago
    * Links in Orange have been submitted more than 15 days ago
    * Otherwise, links will display in the site's standard colour

This block has been designed for use within the Etco environment, there is no guarantee that it will work as intended outside of The Electrical Training Company Ltd.
